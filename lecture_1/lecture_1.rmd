## Technologies that drive the web (and not only)

## What is HTML

### HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and provides the structure of the web page

## HyperText
Hypertext is a text which contains links to other texts

## Markup
### Markup means to mark something up: annotate.

The content should be annotated for machine to tell what the content is
```{html}
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Title of my webpage</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
```
## Language
Every markup language is different and has it's own syntax

```{html}
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Title of my webpage</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>
            <h1> I am a title </h1>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

## What is CSS

### CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is used to describe the presentation of the page.

```{}
body {
    background-color: #cecece;
    font-size: 16px;
}
```

# What is JavaScript ?

## Origins.

JavaScript was written by Branden Eich in 1995, to provide interactivity to webpages.
It is a high-level, interpreted programming language, initially designed for client-side scripting.

## Why is it so popular ?

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=8, echo=FALSE}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("./stack_overflow_survey.png")
 grid.raster(img)
```

* Client-side scripting
* Back-end development (NodeJS)
* Desktop application development
* Mobile development
* Robot manipulation (NodeBot)
